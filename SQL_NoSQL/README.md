## Projects: 
* MySQL.py 
* Oracle.py

## MySQL.py and Oracle.py
These snippets of code help you connect to you a [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) or [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/database/)  database, respectively, in a pythonic manner.

### Inspiration
Some of the companies I've worked have used Oracle and MySQL databases, so I went ahead and created this program to query and analyze/ visualization faster.

### Usage
This code is something that you'd typically copy and paste into a larger program.
