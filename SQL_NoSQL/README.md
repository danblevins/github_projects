# SQL/ NoSQL ðŸ“’
### Projects: MySQL.py, Oracle.py

## MySQL.py
A snippet of code that connects you to your [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) database in a pythonic manner.

### Inspiration
I enjoy using MySQL databases and wanted to go from querying to analysis/ visualization faster, so I created this script to help with that.

### Installation & Usage
1. I'm using Python 3.6.8. Copy and paste the below code in your terminal to see what version you have. If you don't have Python 3 installed, you can learn how to install it [here](https://realpython.com/installing-python).

    `$ python3 --version  # check version number if you're not sure`

2. This code is something that you'd typically copy and paste into a larger program.
    
   
## Oracle.py
A snippet of code that connects you to your [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/database/) database in a pythonic manner.

### Inspiration
Some of the companies I've worked with use Oracle databases, so I went ahead and created this program to query and analyze/ visualization faster.

### Installation & Usage
1. I'm using Python 3.6.8. Copy and paste the below code in your terminal to see what version you have. If you don't have Python 3 installed, you can learn how to install it [here](https://realpython.com/installing-python).

    `$ python3 --version  # check version number if you're not sure`

2. This code is something that you'd typically copy and paste into a larger program.
