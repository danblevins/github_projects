# Web Scraping - SCHEV Scrape ðŸ•¸

## SCHEV Scrape
Scraping the [SCHEV](https://research.schev.edu/) website for higher education data for Economics programs in Virginia's public universities.

:warning: **The [SCHEV website](https://sites.google.com/view/schev-tempsite/home) is currently getting a complete overhaul**, so the code might not be up-to-date until the website is live again.

### Inspiration
This is a snippet of much larger propietary code that's used by the [JMU Economics Advisory Board](https://www.jmu.edu/cob/economics/about/executive-advisory-board.shtml). The complete analysis guides data-driven discussions for the JMU Economics Department and Board.

### Usage
Run the web scrapper

    `$ python3 schev_scrape.py`
