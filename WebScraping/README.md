# Web Scraping ðŸ•¸
### Projects: SCHEV Scrape, The Office Scrape

## SCHEV Scrape
Scraping the [SCHEV](https://research.schev.edu/) website for higher education data for Economics programs in Virginia's public universities.

:warning: **The [SCHEV website](https://sites.google.com/view/schev-tempsite/home) is currently getting a complete overhaul**, so the code might not be up-to-date until the website is live again.

### Inspiration
This is a snippet of much larger propietary code that's used by the [JMU Economics Advisory Board](https://www.jmu.edu/cob/economics/about/executive-advisory-board.shtml). The complete analysis guides data-driven discussions for the JMU Economics Department and Board.

### Installation & Usage
1. I'm using Python 3.6.8. Copy and paste the below code in your terminal to see what version you have. If you don't have Python 3 installed, you can install it [here](https://realpython.com/installing-python).

    `$ python3 --version  # check version number if you're not sure`

2. Run the web scrapper

    `$ python3 schev_scrape.py`
    
   
## The Office Scrape
Scraping all of the lines in Seasons 1 through 7 in [The Office](https://www.officequotes.net/).

### Inspiration
I love The Office and have been a fan since it aired on NBC every Thursday night way back when. It only made sense that I eventually got around to pulling in every line ever said in my favorite TV show.
