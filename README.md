# My Python Projects

## **What** is this?
This is a collection of **beginner Python projects**. The purpose of this exercise is to show how versatile Python can be, especially for beginners, to create vastly different projects without spending too much time. ‚è∞

## **How** does it work?
Each project folder includes the code itself, usage instructions, and additional resources.

## **Why** does this exist?
Ever since I was learning how to code and starting my career in tech, one piece of advice I often heard (and now give) is to *create* as much as possible -- through independent projects, hackathons, etc. But to this day, whenever I sit down wanting to start a new project, my mind goes blank. I always ask myself, ***but what do I make?*** ü§î

I must not be the only one facing this 'idea-block.' So, I wanted to create a beginner-friendly collection of Python projects that are accessible, fun to learn, and easy to clone and expand. üëå

## **Who** created this?
That would be me -- Dan Blevins!
