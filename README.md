## **How** does it work?
Each project folder includes its code, requirements.txt, and additional resources. I like to work on these projects whenever I have free time. ‚è∞

## Installation
For these projects, I'm using Python 3.6.8. Copy and paste the below code in your terminal to see what version you have. If you don't have Python 3 installed, you can learn how to install it [here](https://realpython.com/installing-python).

    `$ python3 --version  # check version number if you're not sure`

The data folder contains data for some of the project examples.

Check the requirements.txt file for more information on libraries and installations.

## **Why** does this exist?
Ever since I started to code, one piece of advice I often heard (and now give) is to *create* as much as possible through independent projects, hackathons, freelance, etc. This is a place for me to do exactly that üë®üèº‚Äçüíª 

## **Who** created this?
That would be me üëãüèº Dan Blevins!
