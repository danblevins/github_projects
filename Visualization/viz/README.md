# Visualization - Viz.py ðŸ“Š

## Viz.py
A snippet of code to quickly create static visualizations using [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/index.html).

### Inspiration
At my first company, one of my projects involved constantly creating static visualizations for slide deck presentations. Seeing that there was an opportunity to create visualizations automatically, I created a small program similar to this code. This is a short piece of that full code.

### Usage
Make visualizations

    `$ python3 viz.py`
