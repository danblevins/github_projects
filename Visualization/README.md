## Viz.py
Scraping the [SCHEV](https://research.schev.edu/) website for higher education data for Economics programs in Virginia's public universities.

### Inspiration
This is a snippet of much larger propietary code that's used by the [JMU Economics Advisory Board](https://www.jmu.edu/cob/economics/about/executive-advisory-board.shtml) and guide data-driven discussions for the JMU Economics Department

## Streamlit.py
Scraping all of the lines in Seasons 1 through 7 in [The Office](https://www.officequotes.net/).

### Inspiration
I love The Office and have been a fan since it aired on NBC every Thursday night way back when. It only made sense that I eventually got around to pulling in every line ever said in my favorite TV show.
