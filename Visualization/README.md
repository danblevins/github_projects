# Visualization ðŸ“Š
### Projects: Viz.py, Streamlit.py

## Viz.py
A snippet of code to quickly create static visualizations using [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/index.html).

### Inspiration
At my [first company](https://www.boozallen.com/), one of my projects involved constantly creating static visualizations for slide deck presentations. Seeing that there was an opportunity to create visualizations automatically, I created a small program similar to this code. This is a short piece of that full code.

### Installation & Usage
1. I'm using Python 3.6.8. Copy and paste the below code in your terminal to see what version you have. If you don't have Python 3 installed, you can learn how to install it [here](https://realpython.com/installing-python).

    `$ python --version  # check version number if you're not sure`

2. Make visualizations

    `$ python3 viz.py`

   
## Streamlit.py
Scraping all of the lines in Seasons 1 through 7 in [The Office](https://www.officequotes.net/).

### Inspiration
I love The Office and have been a fan since it aired on NBC every Thursday night way back when. It only made sense that I eventually got around to pulling in every line ever said in my favorite TV show.

### Installation & Usage
1. I'm using Python 3.6.8. Copy and paste the below code in your terminal to see what version you have. If you don't have Python 3 installed, you can learn how to install it [here](https://realpython.com/installing-python).

    `$ python --version  # check version number if you're not sure`

2. Run Streamlit visualization

    `$ streamlit run streamlit.py`
