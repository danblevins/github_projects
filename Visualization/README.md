# Visualization ðŸ“Š
### Projects: Viz.py, Streamlit.py

## Viz.py
A snippet of code to quickly create static visualizations using [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/index.html).

### Inspiration
At my [first company](https://www.boozallen.com/), one of my projects involved constantly creating static visualizations for slide deck presentations. Seeing that there was an opportunity to create visualizations automatically, I created a small program similar to this code. This is a short piece of that full code.

### Installation & Usage
1. I'm using Python 3.6.8. Copy and paste the below code in your terminal to see what version you have. If you don't have Python 3 installed, you can learn how to install it [here](https://realpython.com/installing-python).

    `$ python --version  # check version number if you're not sure`

2. Make visualizations

    `$ python3 viz.py`

   
## Streamlit.py
Creates three interactive charts to view your marketing KPIs for your European customers.

### Inspiration
[Streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io/) looked like a fast way to "build data apps" so I wanted to try it out and learn something new. I like how there's so much you can visualize using pure programming!

### Installation & Usage
1. I'm using Python 3.6.8. Copy and paste the below code in your terminal to see what version you have. If you don't have Python 3 installed, you can learn how to install it [here](https://realpython.com/installing-python).

    `$ python --version  # check version number if you're not sure`

2. Run Streamlit visualization

    `$ streamlit run streamlit.py`
