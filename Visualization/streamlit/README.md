# Visualization - Streamlit.py ðŸ“Š

## Streamlit.py
Creates three interactive charts to view your marketing KPIs for your European customers.

### Inspiration
[Streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io/) looked like a fast way to "build data apps" so I wanted to try it out and learn something new. I like how there's so much you can visualize using pure programming!

### Installation & Usage
Run Streamlit visualization

    `$ streamlit run streamlit.py`
