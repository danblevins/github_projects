# ML/ NLP - ML.py ⚙️

## ML.py
This program helps you go from a clean dataset to typical machine learning algorithms quickly. This allows more time for data scientists to work on tuning their algorithms.

### Inspiration
With the increase in popularity for data science projects, I wanted to create a program that helped go from clean dataset to machine learning output faster.

### Usage
Run classification and regression algorithms
