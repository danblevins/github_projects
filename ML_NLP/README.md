# ML/ NLP ⚙️
### Projects: ML.py

## ML.py
This program helps you go from a clean dataset to typical machine learning algorithms quickly. This allows more time for data scientists to work on tuning their algorithms.

### Inspiration
With the increase in popularity for data science projects, I wanted to create a program that helped go from clean dataset to machine learning output faster.

### Installation & Usage
1. I'm using Python 3.6.8. Copy and paste the below code in your terminal to see what version you have. If you don't have Python 3 installed, you can learn how to install it [here](https://realpython.com/installing-python).

    `$ python3 --version  # check version number if you're not sure`

2. Run the web scrapper

    `$ python3 ml.py
